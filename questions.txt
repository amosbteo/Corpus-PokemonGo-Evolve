1) Show result-oriented 'evolve [final stage]' is a thing

2) Reasons this might occur


A few thoughts:
- Would be nice to break it down by past-tense vs. non-past. My hypothesis is that the result-oriented might be relatively more frequent in past-tense constructions, because you're presenting an accomplishment or result. Non-past constructions might be more varied (questions, hypotheticals, etc.).
- Might try adding "my/your" to the list of determiners. I did a quick Twitter search and found some examples of both.
- The corpus tool AntConc might be useful for exploring the context around 'evolve/d.' I'm curious to know what pronouns are doing in all of this.
- This is probably beyond the scope of what you want to do, but you could get the frequencies of the different pokemons and see whether they are more or less likely than expected in each construction given their overall frequencies (using Fisher's Exact or log likelihood or some Shannon information tool). 

Surprisal, essentially.
